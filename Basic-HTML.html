	Hello y'all this is Bimo speaking, I just want you to know that this page is under maintenance.
	<hr>
	Thank you very much for your cooperation
	<hr>
	To start a html page you need to first use <"html"><br>
	To create the Title on the tab for your page we are going to use <"head"> and then <"title"><br>
	To work on the body we use are going to use <"body">, <"h1">and<"h2">and<"h3">and so on for the page's header, and <"p"> for the paragraph<br>
	To end the code simply put the respective tag and put the "/"(without quotation marks) before the name of the tag e.g. <"/p">,<"/h1">,<"/body"> and so on<br>
	All tags are written without quotation marks<br>
	</p>
